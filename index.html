                            <article id="design" class="panel">
                                <header>
                                    <h2>Design</h2>
                                </header>
                                
                                <h3>Notification</h3>
                                <p>Our main goal is to notify a user when they receive mail in their mailbox, so our first design decision centered around how to send this notification. We considered text messages, emails, and even twitter, all of which would be possible using Python. We’ve chosen email as our first and primary method of user notification. Email is a means of conveying similar information--information about meetings, about orders, and about deliveries--and is the natural manner of letting users know that they’ve got mail.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Wireless Connectivity</h3>   
                                <p>Our next design decision involved determining how to connect the sensors in the mailbox to our online notification center. A Raspberry Pi, [RPi] which lacks an analog to digital converter [ADC], would make it more difficult to interface with some very useful sensors. Additionally, an RPi running as a mobile sensing unit would consume relatively great amounts of power and lacks a native wireless connectivity option--not ideal for a compact, self-contained sensing unit. A microcontroller, such as the Arduino, is closer to what we need--Arduinos cost less than an RPi and make it easier to interface with sensors. However, wireless connectivity is still a relatively expensive add-on.<br>

                                Due to these design considerations, we have chosen a Spark Core as the most effective hardware for our purposes. Spark Core is a tiny microcontroller with tightly integrated wireless connectivity. It allows us to remotely read sensors and run functions using an API.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Server</h3>   
                                <p>We determined that we have a need for a server which runs continuously in order to routinely check the mailboxes and send notifications. In future iterations, it is possible that this server need will be met using a Raspberry Pi. However now, in our initial phases of development, using a computer works just fine.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Model</h3>   
                                <p>We chose to build a model of one of the Olin mailboxes so we could run tests outside of the mailroom.  We used the dimensions from the mailboxes and built a replica out of wood.  By having a 3D model that is mobile, we are able to make sure all of our components fit inside of the mailbox and we can rapidly prototype without having to constantly go into the mailroom, which is especially important if we are working when the mailroom is closed.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Sensors</h3>   
                                <p>We are still working on determining the best type of sensor for the job. So far, we have considered pressure sensors and light beam IR sensors. Pressure sensors might not be sensitive enough to account for lighter pieces of mail. IR sensors might be too easily tripped. We plan to experiment with different types of sensors in order to find the best available technology.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Objected Oriented Code</h3>   
                                <p>Our class structure was designed to allow for ease of scaling. First, we created a Mailbox object. Each Mailbox object in our current iteration has three attributes: got_mail, owner, and last_notified.<br>

                                got_mail returns either true or false depending on whether or not there is mail contained in the mailbox.<br>
                                owner contains the contact information of the owner of the mailbox, at this point, their email address.<br>
                                last_notified returns the time that the user was last pinged. The goal of this attribute is to prevent email spamming of the user. This is useful if we only want to notify the user once per mail item, or if we want to remind them that a piece of mail has been . This is reset whenever the sensor records more mail or when the user removes the mail.<br>

                                Each Mailbox also has a method called notify_owner() which sends an email when the sensor detects mail in the mailbox of the user. It also records the time that this notification is sent, to be used by the attribute last_notified.
                                Once we expand to have multiple Mailboxes, it will be useful for scaling to be able to access a collection of Mailboxes. In order to  do this, we have created a Mailroom class. The Mailroom class currently contains the operating hours of the Mailroom and  a collection of Mailboxes.
                                </p>

                                <h3>UML Diagram</h3>   
                                <p>Here is our working UML diagram, described by the Object Oriented Code in the previous section.

                                <h3>Development Plan: Next Steps</h3>
                                <ul>
